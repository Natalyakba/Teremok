Project: Laboratory Work on "Databases" on the Topic "Fairy Tale"

Assignment: Database development, table creation, and familiarization with entities, keys, attributes, and other aspects of database design.

Tasks:

Create an HTML page with the text of the fairy tale.
Enhance the page with CSS to create a colorful and visually appealing interface.
Design database entities — plan the structure of the database and relationships between entities.
Integrate the database into the project — embed the database and establish a connection with the web page.
Enable entity modification — add functionality that allows users to modify and update various database entities.


Conclusions:
during the course of the project, we learned that database design should precede interface design, rather than the other way around, as was initially done in the project.
